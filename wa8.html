<p>The code I used to gather the data is <a href="starter_code_wa_8.ipynb">here</a>. I separated the data by precinct. Then I gathered how many stops were made and the if those stops ended in arrests to finally calculate the percent of stops made that ended in arrests by precinct. In order to do this I iterated through each stop in each precinct and checked whether or not the stop ended in an arrest. </p>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>From this data we are able to conclude that the majority of stops do not end in arrests. The highest arrest rate per stop is in precinct 211 at 25%. This is because most things that a police officer can make a stop for are not arrestable offenses. This shows how a majority of interactions with police officers in colorado do not end in arrest. An interesting question to look into after this would be what the percentage of arrests are by the race of the person being stopped. This would be interesting to see if there is a racial bias involved with arrests.</p>
