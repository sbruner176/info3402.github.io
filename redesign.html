 <a href="sbruner176.github.io/inspiration.html">Inspiration Page</a> 

<p>For the style of the <a href="sbruner176.github.io/personal_website.html">Home Page</a> and the rest of the sites I went with one main color filling the navigation bar on the side of the page. </p>
 
<p> In order to make the <a href="sbruner176.github.io/aboutme.html">About Me</a> page look nicer I separated things out into subjects. There is also a class that shifts the dates to the right side of the page.</p>

<p> In order to make the <a href="sbruner176.github.io/portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> improved I resised the pictures so that they would fit in the screen at any size.</p>

<p> In order to  make the <a href="sbruner176.github.io/contact.html">Contact</a> page improved some of the links were put into icons.</p>
