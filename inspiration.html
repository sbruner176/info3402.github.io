<p> I liked the <a href="alieward.com">Alie Ward</a> website mostly for its movement of the page and the color scheme. For the movement I specifically liked how the backgroud like images moved or did not really move in conjucnction with the scrolling. With the color scheme I was a fan of sticking to the two colors just so it did not look too crowded. </p>

<p> I focused on science communicators and their websites. Another website I liked was <a href="ayanaelizabeth.com"> Ayana Elizabeth Johnson</a>. The first thing that stands are the large pictures immediately shown on the website. I also think the font is great.</p>
