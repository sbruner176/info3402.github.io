	<p>	The incredible growth of the GameStop stock caused by reddit users has destabilized the stock market in a new way. Brought about by a confluence of new technology and old ideas, the destabilization offers insights into how interactions with the stock market have, and could continue to, change in response to a changing climate around the stock market. As technology continues to further integrate into our lives it is likely that similar events will continue to pop up depending on what actions are taken right now. This event is important for predicting the future of the stock market in conjunction with new and evolving technology. </p>
 	<p>An important aspect of the GameStop-WallStreetBets event is the ability for people to gather and pool their resources at a rapid pace into one stock. This development has only been recently made possible with the introduction of the internet allowing people easier interaction with other people and the stock market. The event would likely not have been possible before the advent of technology making it easy for people to gather suddenly and with great mass. In this way technology has opened new possibilities for a greater number of people to interact with and change the way the stock market is used. But this expansion of the stock market is not without consequences as seen in the event. Hedgefunds lost millions of dollars during this, demonstrating how a change in how people interact with the stock market will not benefit everybody involved. Technology also enabled this story to be spread around the united states rapidly through news sites and social medias. In this way instead of being a singular event, there was a rise of similar actions to other similarly shorted stocks further disrupting the stock market. </p>
	<p>These new interactions with the stock market have implications for what may happen in the future. It has been evident in news surrounding the event that there are many different opinions on whether or not this was a good thing for the stock market. Regardless of the debate on if it is good or not, it is more important that something like this has happened and it is likely to happen again as technology changes how people interact with the stock market. It will be impossible to keep the stock market the same as it has always been as it is a direct reflection of what is happening in the society around us. As attitudes in the united states changes, so will the stock market change to reflect this. In this instance, the growing national understanding of inequality has been reflected in actions taken agains large corporations making lots of money on the assumption that other companies were going to fail. This is not to say that growing awareness of inequality has caused the events that happened, but rather they are reflections of each other. </p>
	<p>There is more access to the stock market enabled by the integration and improvement of technology as well as a seemingly ever increasingly polarized population with fast changing attitudes. These facts have highlighted a conflict between conservative views of the stock market and new progressive ideas which will likely result in more strange events relating to the stock market as a new balance between old and new is argued about in the future.
